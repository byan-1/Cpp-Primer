l1: q is a pointer to an int initialized with value 42, r is a pointer to an int initialized with value 100

l2: r now points to q. the address pointed to by r is leaking.

q2 is a shared ptr with value 42, r2 is a shared ptr with value 100
r2 now points to q2, r2's old address is automatically freed.
